@Joey Roth The already deployed contracts have been audited before?

{Reactions}
👍 

[04/18/2024 20:20] abcdefghxxxxxxxxx
why is  ``script/deploy/Deploy.V2.s.sol ``   in scope    +    those contracts deployed should be looked at by auditors ?


[04/18/2024 20:25] joeyroth
Currently deployed contracts have been audited. We’re including the deploy scripts for new contracts in the current audit scope


[04/18/2024 20:26] abcdefghxxxxxxxxx
so the scope is those 6 contracts from the ``scope.txt``  (  whitout the deploy script  )  to make everything clear


[04/18/2024 20:26] abcdefghxxxxxxxxx
``` ./src/core/VaultManagerV2.sol

[04/19/2024 10:18] ehjc
The overall minimum CR should be 150% as you said. The rule above talks about what portion of this should be exogenous collateral. This needs to be at least 100% where the rest 50% could be filled by Kerosene. Note that the deterministic value of Kerosene itself is the surplus exogenous collateral divided by the circulating Kerosene supply


[04/19/2024 10:19] ehjc
This means if the surplus in the system goes to zero so should the price of Kerosene. It’s not based on market prices


[04/19/2024 10:36] brivan
> Note that the deterministic value of Kerosene itself is the surplus exogenous collateral divided by the circulating Kerosene supply
Speaking about this, a question arises and I believe it is already asked up in the chat. In `KerosineDenominator::denominator` you are subtracting the Kerosine's MAINNET_OWNER balance from the Kerosine's totalSupply and you mentioned it is not a great solution. Why is that?


[04/19/2024 10:59] ehjc
Ideally, you’d have an on-chain solution to get the circulating supply (different than balanceOf), which we use to determine the deterministic Kerosene price. However, we found so far no convincing solution for that purpose. Therefore, this approach was chosen for now, but it is upgradable.

Hi, @ehjc. There can be several `VaultManagerV2`?


[04/19/2024 12:15] davies_0212
What about `KerosineManager`? Only one for entire protocol, or one for each `VaultManagerV2`?


[04/19/2024 12:16] ehjc
Should be one vault manager but @shafu will confirm


[04/19/2024 12:16] davies_0212
Thx.


[04/19/2024 12:21] shafu0x
Only one


[04/19/2024 12:21] shafu0x
Yes later


[04/19/2024 12:22] davies_0212
What about `KerosineManager`? Only one for the entire protocol?

[04/19/2024 12:31] ehjc
Kerosene it is


[04/19/2024 12:37] 0x74554
what's the difference between the bounded and unbounded kerosene vault ?


[04/19/2024 12:37] 0x74554
maybe dumb question lol


[04/19/2024 12:39] volokinn
bounded - cannot withdraw, unbounded - free to withdraw, you can check the implementation.


[04/19/2024 12:39] volokinn
furthermore the assets price of bounded kerosene deposits is *2 because it is locked.


[04/19/2024 12:41] 0x74554
okay now it makes sense, thx ser.


[04/19/2024 12:49] _karanel
So there can be a maximum of 10 licensed KeroseneVaults (either bounded or unbounded), right?


[04/19/2024 12:51] _karanel
While there can be any number of licensed token Vaults.
And a DNft can have 5 KeroseneVaults and 5 token Vaults.


[04/19/2024 12:52] shafu0x
No up to 10 vaults that are considered in the kerosene price calculation


[04/19/2024 13:20] xkeywordx
@shafu at the end of the day is the `script/deploy/Deploy.V2.s.sol` in scope or not for the audit?


[04/19/2024 13:21] shafu0x

START_PRICE and PRICE_INCREASE will be zero during real deployment?

DYAD design outline v6 | Notion
DYAD is the first truly capital efficient decentralized stablecoin. Traditionally, two costs make stablecoins inefficient: surplus collateral and DEX liquidity. DYAD minimizes both of these costs through Kerosene, a token that lowers the individual cost to mint DYAD.

File explicitly in scope (VaultManagerV2.sol) imports and heavily depends on files explicitly out of scope (DNft.sol, Dyad.sol, Licenser.sol, Vault.sol). You can't reasonably audit the former without the latter.

@shafu  Does my understanding about vaults is correct - my understanding is that each vault is unique for each collateral and each vault contains a mapping id2Asset. Where id is the id of the DNFt and asset is basically the amount of collateral deposited by the user. But it is confusing to me how this whole think works ?

Guys, could someone help me understand the purpose of this mapping? What does the first uint represent? Is it an ID of the asset in the vault or something else? I totally got confused ... 
```    mapping(uint => uint) public id2asset;
```


[04/20/2024 16:52] infectedfuture
id2asset[dNFT id] = desposited asset balance


[04/20/2024 16:53] infectedfuture
so each vaults (can be wsteth vault, kerosene vault, ...) keep track of deposits for a dNFT position


[04/20/2024 16:55] krisp6347
what exactly dNFT is I wasn't able to understand. It gives you some rights to mint in a cheaper way, but why do we need an nft id in the vault, and why do we use its id to track how much asset we've deposited. This confuses me. Let's say we have Vault, simple WETH Vault, what dNFT will be here ?


[04/20/2024 16:57] micc01
is 1DYAD = 1$???


[04/20/2024 16:58] infectedfuture
If my understanding is correct, users do not own a vault. 
There's only one instance of each vault for everyone. 
Users cannot directly interact with vaults (because of `onlyVaultManager` modifier), they need to go through VaultManagerV2
VaultManagerV2 have `isDNftOwner` and `isValidDNft` modifier to ensure caller of the function own a DNFT


[04/20/2024 16:58] micc01
???


[04/20/2024 17:00] iwildsniperi
that is the goal of the protocol


[04/20/2024 17:02] micc01
yeah , i was asking this because in the test they mint 1e20 DYAD so I was kinda suspicious 😳


[04/20/2024 17:02] krisp6347
Yeah, yeah I understand this part, but I cannot understand why do we need NFT altogether ? 😅  I mean - let's for example say we are dealing with the WETH vault. What this function should return 
```   function getUsdValue(uint id) external view returns (uint) {
        return
            (id2asset[id] * assetPrice() * 1e18) /
            10 ** oracle.decimals() /
            10 ** asset.decimals();
    }
```


[04/20/2024 17:03] krisp6347
The current USD value of all of the WETH deposited into this WETH vault ?


[04/20/2024 17:05] iwildsniperi
tied to the dNFT

[04/20/2024 17:06] iwildsniperi
sorry but where are the suspicioun?


[04/20/2024 17:07] krisp6347
so basically, `getUsdValue()` func from above will return how much collateral a particular user deposited, as he will pass his nft id to it, is my understanding correct ?


[04/20/2024 17:07] micc01
that are they minting 1e20 dollars or do it functions like eth (1e18 wei) , i mean fungible


[04/20/2024 17:10] jvorex
1e20 means mint 100 DYAD stablecoins.

unlicensed vaults serve no purpose until they become licensed, which currently happens via msig and in the future via governance


[04/20/2024 18:08] ivi4yh3ivi
so the current price to mintNft is 0.745 eth and that's just to gain entry to system? user would still need to add vault and deposit on top of that?


[04/20/2024 18:10] krisp6347
@MaxCould you explain the purpose behind this function and the idea behind users ability to add vaults to their NFT ?

```    function add(uint id, address vault) external isDNftOwner(id) {
        if (vaults[id].length() >= MAX_VAULTS) revert TooManyVaults();
        if (!vaultLicenser.isLicensed(vault)) revert VaultNotLicensed();

Sorry, I didn't quite catch that. Could you please elaborate a bit more? I'm having trouble understanding. So, if I understand correctly, there is one WETH vault for the entire protocol where we can deposit, and our deposits are tracked by our individual NFTs, right?

one vault per asset type.


[04/20/2024 18:28] wanziskata
🧐


[04/20/2024 18:29] krisp6347
I see, but isn't it that let's say for every asset(erc-20) there should be one vault e.g.  WETH we have one vault, one for wsETH, so on
```  address MAINNET_WETH_VAULT      = 0xcF97cEc1907CcF9d4A0DC4F492A3448eFc744F6c;
  address MAINNET_WSTETH_VAULT    = 0x7aE80418051b2897729Cbdf388b07C5158C557A1;
```

They will be deployed by the protocol right, and as a user how can I use the `function add(uint id, address vault)` for adding a vault, to where I should add it and why I should add it as there are already deployed vaults ?

because when I want to deposit I'll call 
```
    function deposit(

        address vault,
        uint amount
    ) external isValidDNft(id) {

        _vault.asset().safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(vault), amount);
        _vault.deposit(id, amount);
    }
``` 
wtih WETH vault address and it will deposit my WETH to this vault and it will be tracked by my nft id, right ? What is the purpose of having `add(uint id, address vault)` in case where we will have one vault per asset type ?


[04/20/2024 18:31] wanziskata
sure, I understood that, but as shafu replied, the boundedVault can be added "later"; would that mean that VaultManagerV2 will later be upgraded so it supports boundedVaults, or does it currently support them?

If you are holding different types of tokens and would like to use them as collateral you can do it via multiple vaults if the system accepts them (has vaults created for them)

if there weren't ways to add new vaults you would have to use one vault so that would require you to swap to that token first and then deposit to that vault

@shafu, could you confirm if I understand the liquidation process correctly? The liquidator pays the amount of DYAD tokens equal to user's DYAD minted balance. In return, they receive that same amount(as the amount they've liquidated) + 20% bonus from the collateral of the liquidated user. And if there's any collateral remaining from the user's position after the liquidation, can the user redeem it?

Depends on you which collateral type you have deposited into your dNFT


[04/21/2024 09:45] mrmorningstar96
Got it so they can withdraw different tokens depending on what they deposited (currently kerosene, wEth and wstETH) from the non bounded vault, and in bounded vault only kerosene can be deposited but it cannot be withdrawn

DYAD V2 - Kerosene - Code4rena Audit
DYAD is the first truly capital efficient decentralized stablecoin. Traditionally, two costs make stablecoins inefficient: surplus collateral and DEX liquidity. DYAD minimizes both of these costs through Kerosene, a token that lowers the individual cost to mint DYAD.

Is there any scenario where there is more than one Vault with the same assets(e.g 2 different Vaults with wETH as an asset) ?


[04/21/2024 15:37] itsabinashb
@shafu please check my private thread #deleted-channel


[04/21/2024 15:49] kristiqniliev57
Maybe I don't quite get the purpose that Vaults serve. I will describe what my understanding as of now is and I'd be glad if you correct the flaws:
There are a limited number of Vaults distinguished by what asset(wstETH, wETH, Kerosene) you can mint DYAD against. 
A DNft holder can add Vaults to which they can deposit collateral and mint DYAD or burn DYAD and get back their asset(used as collateral) 
What confuses me is the maximum Kerosene Vaults that can be issued which is set to five.
The latter implies one of two things:
* There can be multiple Vaults issued of the same kind (if that is the case my understanding has drifted off into some wrong direction and i would like to know what the purpose behind that is)
* There is room left for other types of Kerosine Vaults (other than bounded and unbounded) that can be added in the future

`mintedDyad ` is a mapping in `vault.sol` 
``` // vault manager => (dNFT ID => dyad)
  mapping (address => mapping (uint => uint)) public mintedDyad; 
```
but in VaultMangerV2 it declares as calling a  function(in mintDyad function)
```
uint newDyadMinted = dyad.mintedDyad(address(this), id) + amount;
```
can anyone explain me why there is difference in declarations. @shafu


[04/22/2024 05:52] aamirusmani1552
Because every public variable can be called like a function in solidity. You don't have to declare a getter function for it.


[04/22/2024 05:53] vizay315

what is unbounded kerosine valut use？why it's asset price is double of bound kerosine vault?


[04/22/2024 11:40] jvorex
double because you can't withdraw your Kerosene tokens deposited in. Use: to take in Kerosene tokens deposited against a NOTE token and can be withdrawn anytime


[04/22/2024 11:49] linmiaomiao_qaq
I can't understand its use,and can't see any about this in doc,can you explain more detail about this?


[04/22/2024 11:52] jvorex
overtime according to the teams plans, DYAD stablecoins can be minted with endogenous asset in this case Kerosene tokens (since its the same team that deploys the token). So if a Kerosene token were to be used as a collateral token to mint DYAD stablecoin, then such Kerosene token needs to go some place because each vault has only 1 asset type e.g we can't send Kerosene into a wETH vault (that would be two assets now in one vault) so Kerosene tokens go to Kerosene vaults, wETH collateral go to wETH vault.

[04/22/2024 11:54] jvorex
unbounded means if I were to provide Kerosene token for minting 100 DYAD stablecoins, at some point when I need those tokens back, I can withdraw the collateral Kerosene but in the case of a bounded kerosene vault, whatever Kerosene goes in never comes out


[04/22/2024 11:59] linmiaomiao_qaq
thanks，I understand.Because it's bound and kerosine will not be withdrawn,this part kerosine token will transfer to dyad token to be bound, alright?

Thanks @0xfox, I think I understood now. You mentioned ` + reward if any` my understanding was that the liquidator always receives his 20% reward, is my understanding incorrect ?


[04/22/2024 14:20] 0xfox_
they won't receive a reward if the liquidatee is insolvent aka if the liquidatee is not overcollateralized for example they hold 100 DYAD and 90$ of collateral

📢 Wardens, The only tokens in scope are weth, wsteth, and the ones [defined here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad?tab=readme-ov-file#general-questions)

Vulnerabilities related to these token behaviours are only considered valid if they actually exist in tokens which are used, e.g. Kerosene, weth, etc.

Question about deposit. When I call `VaultManagerV2.deposit()`, it will then call `Vault.deposit()` and there is check `onlyVaultManager()`  `if (msg.sender != address(vaultManager)) revert NotVaultManager();` in place. 

How can I perform deposit when I don't have controll to vaultManager address to perform deposit?


[04/23/2024 03:43] irreverent.eth
be a dnft owner


[04/23/2024 03:44] thesavageteddy
i dont understand this question, you should be able to deposit through vaultmanagerv2?


[04/23/2024 03:47] elizabeth8460u
vaultManager will be msg.sender in subsequent when u call deposit() on it


[04/23/2024 04:03] s1h4y4_
But there is a check on `Vault.deposit()` (which is called by `vaultManagerV2.deposit()`) that checks if the msg.sender is the address(vaultManager)


[04/23/2024 04:03] s1h4y4_
Hmm I thought the msg.sender will remain as my address throughout the transaction


[04/23/2024 04:05] mctoady
tx.origin is your address, msg.sender is the address the call comes from (in this case vaultManagerV2)


[04/23/2024 04:09] mctoady

DYAD V2- Kerosene - Code4rena Audit #2
DYAD is the first truly capital efficient decentralized stablecoin. Traditionally, two costs make stablecoins inefficient: surplus collateral and DEX liquidity. DYAD minimizes both of these costs through Kerosene, a token that lowers the individual cost to mint DYAD.

in the deploy script shouldn't we add `unboundedKerosineVault` to `vaultManager`? using `addKerosene`


[04/23/2024 06:42] nilay27
those methods are supposed to be called by the owners of dnft, if you see that there is a check `isDNftOwner`, `addKerosene` is used by the owners of dnft to add the kerosene vaults that they want to associate their dnft with.

decimals of the underlying vault asset?


[04/23/2024 11:30] guy_in0xnito
Then what is asset.decimals?


[04/23/2024 11:33] mctoady
the oracle returns the price of the asset with decimals:
ETH  = 315023 (2 decimals = 3150.23)

the asset has its own decimals (eth having 18)


[04/23/2024 11:40] thesavageteddy
i'm not certain, but i think vault.asset.decimals queries and returns the decimals of the token directly, while oracle.decimals is the decimals returned by the chain link oracle


[04/23/2024 11:40] thesavageteddy
so they should be the same i think?


[04/23/2024 11:44] aamirusmani1552
The usd chainlink price feeds of assets gives answer in 8 decimals. while tokens in scope has 18 decimals.

If the multisig(MAINNET_OWNER) transfer kerisone to the staking contract, kerosine price will be decrease. It may lead to liquidation depending on the transfer amount. How will the protocol handle this situation?


[04/24/2024 02:50] iwildsniperi
it will be vested lineary


[04/24/2024 02:50] iwildsniperi
not like bulk transfer


[04/24/2024 02:50] iwildsniperi
and liquidations is the user responsibility to add more collateral


[04/24/2024 02:51] iwildsniperi
```    
    // @dev: We subtract all the Kerosene in the multi-sig.
    //       We are aware that this is not a great solution. That is
    //       why we can switch out Denominator contracts.

[04/24/2024 02:58] zhuyingqiuhua
Now the staking contract has kerosine, but if kerosine in staking contract is distributed fully to users as rewards.  The multisig need to transfer kerisine to staking contract to continue providing rewards.

VaultManagerV2 got upgraded from VaultManager ?


[04/24/2024 15:57] zhuyingqiuhua
VaultManager can't be upgraded. My guess is that `Vault Manager Licenser` remove `VaultManager` and add `VaultManagerV2` and let users move funds out and deposit into new vault.

[04/24/2024 23:20] idarrha_adam
the question is not why it need 1.5$ for every dyad minted, why does it need it to be in weth and wsteth and not kerosen token


[04/24/2024 23:25] iwildsniperi
to keep DYAD backed by 1$ collat


[04/24/2024 23:26] iwildsniperi
its like why circle have 1 bank usd for every usdc


[04/24/2024 23:26] ljj
Because then you don't need to deposit any new wETH etc into the protocol if you used the Kerosene to mint dyad without depositing any exogenous collateral it would mean that Kerosene value would go down


[04/24/2024 23:27] idarrha_adam
ok thanks

why its' reducing the amount here `id2asset[id] -= amount;`   ?


[04/25/2024 05:44] aamirusmani1552
What you mean here? Shouldn't it reduce the amount if you withdraw from the vault? or you mean something else


[04/25/2024 05:47] dinesh11g
I mean i didn't understood the reason why it's reducing the balance of a specific `asset` associated with the given `id` by the amount being withdrawn.


[04/25/2024 05:52] aamirusmani1552
That is completely the opposite of when you deposit. Your balance in the vault is tracked like `TokenId => Amount Deposited`.


[04/25/2024 05:58] dinesh11g
ok, but why not it's not withdrawing the same amount it deposited ? Why it's reducing


[04/25/2024 05:59] aamirusmani1552
you can't withdraw more. It will overflow


[04/25/2024 06:03] dinesh11g
so it causes overflow even it wants to withdraw the same amount ?


[04/25/2024 06:05] aamirusmani1552
no it should work in this case


[04/25/2024 06:06] dinesh11g
no Natspec why it's reducing the amount from the asset


[04/25/2024 06:08] 0xlemon

No, asset is tied to a vault.
But a dNFT position can have multiple vaults attached to it, so you can deposit multiple assets in your dNFT and mint DYAD against your total collateral

I was still auditing ( because I was late in the contest ) and I was pretty sure about one HIGH vulnerability but wasn't able to create POC before the time ends :(. And guess what, I found another vulnerability due to which I was getting issue in creating POC :(. Wasn't able to submit 2 HIGH then.

Although I've submitted 1 H + 1 M  + QA. But I'm pretty sure that H and M which I've submitted will be duplicate.

If even top 5 doesn't eat well
This is exhausting


[04/25/2024 21:11] forgebyola
The opportunities really come when you get really good. The top guys would earn way more than those finding dupes every contest. So the target is just keep auditing, getting better and don't worry too much about payout at the beginning

No one will attack your findings. If someone sees that an issue is wrongly judged, he will just highlight it to the judge **with evidences and proofs**. If not he, will get warnings or even will be removed from backstage access. 
There are rules for escalating, and the judge has always the final decision. No need to worry.

Hi @shafu, I know the audit is over but I have a question out of curiosity. In `UnboundedKerosineVault::assetPrice()` there is the following:
```
uint numerator   = tvl - dyad.totalSupply();
uint denominator = kerosineDenominator.denominator();
return numerator * 1e8 / denominator;
```
What does 1e8 represent here?


[04/29/2024 04:53] bigsam0831
Probably a price multiplier since price is also scaled down by this factor when assetprice is used


[04/29/2024 08:44] jes16jupyter
oracle price has 8 decimals i guess.


[04/29/2024 08:55] arkan2245
I noticed a lot of people think it's different things. Hopefully I can summon @shafu to get the answer


[04/29/2024 09:20] kmm77
numerator is 18 decimals * another 8 decimals will be 26 decimals. 
Then divide it by another 18, since the denominator( Kerosene) has 18 decimals, which will return the price in 8 decimals.


[04/29/2024 09:21] kmm77
Basically used, to make the `assetPrice()` function return with precision of 8 decimals, since all of the other vaults return in 8 decimals, because of the oracle

Guys, while the competition is in this stage, is there a way for us, wardens to see what the judge thinks of our submissions?

You need backstage access

how to access backstage?


[04/30/2024 08:02] tigerfrake
First you gotta get certified, then you need to meet some qualifications for it.

Lookout groups similar issues together. Sponsors do not have to go over each submission, so you might get it so far that number of dups is crazy.

From what I've seen competitive audits are a lot harder than private audits. Ofc, it depends on the protocol that you audit privately.


[05/03/2024 09:34] iwildsniperi
getting your name to be booked privately are through dominating audits though
this is the roadmap for nonreffered non employed auditor

[05/03/2024 09:36] xkeywordx
I've seen not so good auditors being booked for private audits because they have good marketing.

But I agree, if you are able to put your name on the C4 leaderboard than ur chances of getting booked privately should go up

I'm not a big c4 'Escalator' but I have small prior experience from another you-know-which-one audit platform. and I hope c4 escalation will not became as same as toxic as on the other platform


[05/16/2024 14:23] brivan
No worries about this -so far-. C4 escalation is the clearest and most well-organized process among all other platforms.
Generally, audits with huge participations -like this one- make it hard to resolve all escalations perfectly.

May I ask, the escalation process is like Sherlock??  How does you know when to write commit?


[05/17/2024 07:06] dimulski
I guess you mean comment, it is pretty much the same with some nuances, here it is called PJQA and only sr can see the escalation, while in Sherlock it is called escalation period and everybody can see the escalations and comment (there are requirements for escalating)


[05/17/2024 07:13] lian0669
Yes comment. Thanks for answering me the question. It helps a lot

PJQA ends today, and given the high number of escalations, I'd say it will require 3 more days to resolve all escalations. Probably Tuesday

how to make an escalation?


[05/17/2024 13:00] theschnilch
You must have the SR role to have access to the Findings Repository to be able to make escalations there

Nah, dimulski probably got to it first lol. Doubt it was a solo but who knows.

Hi, to somebody who has more experience in PJQA, should this have a `duplicate-67` label since the judge confirmed it is a dup of #67, but did not add a label ? https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad-findings/issues/918

you would need SR/backstage role

I figured. I was on my phone. I just clicked to open thinking that the results are published

this is correct, judge should add the label when he's back

i still don't see how it's an issue 🙈 
Maybe I need to read the issue with a fresh mind but imo the liquidator gets the corresponding exo collateral, unbounded kerosene and bounded kerosene which has a 2x value. he can use that bounded kerosene (at a 2x value) to mint stable Dyad

1. PJQA ended long ago, even if some ppl commented without being  asked to do so.
2. I don't want to prolong the judging phase. I believe the judge has enough context to make the right decision. 
I just want to have a constructive discussion to understand other ppl's  POV regarding different issues/ why they think those are valid issues.
